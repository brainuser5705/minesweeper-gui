        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            I decided to make my command line Minesweeper program into a GUI for
            fun after learning about how to make them with JavaFX in class. It's a
            simple program, so extra functionalities like chording, timing or any
            other features commonly found in Minesweeper programs are not included.
        </p>
        <h3>Notes about Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            I used recursion to implement Minesweeper which limits the possible
            dimension sizes due to stack overflow for large sizes (80-90+ rows and columns). The grids will not reveal and the command line where you write the program will display an error.
        </p>
        <h3>Image Credits</h3>
        <p>
            All graphics (not including the JavaFX components) are made by me,
            except for the ‘7’ icon for the numbered cell, Rosé pictures on the
            new game button, and the flag icon (credit below).
